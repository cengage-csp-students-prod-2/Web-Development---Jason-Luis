<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
We make ourselves a place apart
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Behind light words that tease and flout,
<br/>
 But oh, the agitated heart
 <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Till someone find us really out.
<br/>
'Tis pity if the case require
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     (Or so we say) that in the end
<br/>
We speak the literal to inspire
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The understanding of a friend.
<br/>
But so with all, from babes that play
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     At hide-and-seek to God afar,
<br/>
So all who hide too well away
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Must speak and tell us there they are.
