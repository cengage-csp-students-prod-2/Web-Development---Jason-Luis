<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

We make ourselves a place apart
     Behind light words that tease and flout,
 But oh, the agitated heart
     Till someone find us really out.
<br>&nbsp;<br />
'Tis pity if the case require
     (Or so we say) that in the end
We speak the literal to inspire
     The understanding of a friend.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
But so with all, from babes that play
     At hide-and-seek to God afar,
So all who hide too well away
     Must speak and tell us there they are.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
