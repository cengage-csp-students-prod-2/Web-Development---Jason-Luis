<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<br>We make ourselves a place apart</br>
     <br>Behind light words that tease and flout,</br>
 <br>But oh, the agitated heart</br>
     <br>Till someone find us really out.</br>
&nbsp;
<br>'Tis pity if the case require</br>
     <br>(Or so we say) that in the end</br>
<br>We speak the literal to inspire</br>
     <br>The understanding of a friend.</br>
&nbsp;
<br>But so with all, from babes that play</br>
     <br>At hide-and-seek to God afar,</br>
<br>So all who hide too well away</br>
     <br>Must speak and tell us there they are.</br>
