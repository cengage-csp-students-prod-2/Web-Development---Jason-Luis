<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
&nbsp;
We make ourselves a place apart<br />
     Behind light words that tease and flout,<br />
 But oh, the agitated heart<br />
     Till someone find us really out.<br />
&nbsp;
'Tis pity if the case require<br />
     (Or so we say) that in the end<br />
We speak the literal to inspire<br />
     The understanding of a friend.<br />
&nbsp;
But so with all, from babes that play<br />
     At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br />
So all who hide too well away<br />
     Must speak and tell us there they are.<br />
