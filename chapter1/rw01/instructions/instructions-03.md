# Create the Homepage

Go to the _mp_pages.txt_ file in your text editor. This file contains the text content of the four pages in the Mobile Panini website. Copy the text of the Welcome section, which will be used in the home page of the website. Return to _mp_index.html_ in your HTML editor and paste the copied text into the article element.

Within the `article element`, do the following:

1. Mark the "Welcome" line as an `h1` heading.
2. Below the `h1` element, insert an inline image containing the _mp_photo1.png_ file with an empty text string for the alternate text.
3. Mark the next five paragraphs as paragraphs using the `p` element. Within the first paragraph, mark the text **Mobile Panini** as strong text. Within the third paragraph mark the text **Curbside Thai** as emphasized text.
4. The fourth paragraph contains Mobile Panini’s phone number. Mark the phone number as a telephone link and be sure to include the international code in the URL.
5. The fifth paragraph contains Mobile Panini’s email address. Mark the email address as a hypertext link.

> Note that the number and email address are fictional, so, if you have access to a mobile browser and want to test either link, you might want to replace the number or email address with your own.

# Verify Your Progress

Pause and verify that the layout and appearance of the page resemble that shown in _Figure 1–50_. If possible, test the telephone links and email links to verify that they open the correct application.
