# Creating the Menu Page
Go to the *mp_index.html* file in your HTML editor, and copy the `header` and `footer` elements. Then go to the *mp_menu.html* file in your HTML editor and paste the `header` and `footer` elements into the `body` element so that this page has the same logo and navigation list and footer used in the home page. Insert an `article` element between the `header` and `footer`.

Return to the *mp_pages.txt* file in your text editor and copy the contents of the Mobile Panini menu. Then, go to the *mp_menu.html* file in your HTML editor and paste the copied text into the `article` element.

Within the `article` element of the *mp_menu.html* file, do the following: 
1. Mark the text title **Our Menu** as an `h1` heading.
2. Enclose the menu items in a description list with the name of each menu item marked with the `dt` element and each menu description marked with the `dd` element.

# Creating the Events Page
Go to the *mp_index.html* file in your HTML editor and copy the `header` and `footer` elements. Then, go to the *mp_events.html* file in your HTML editor and paste the `header` and `footer` elements into the `body` element. Insert an `article` element between the `header` and `footer`.

Return to the *mp_pages.txt* file in your text editor and copy the list of upcoming events at the bottom of the file. Then, go to the *mp_events.html* file in your HTML editor and paste the copied text into the `article` element.

Within the `article` element, do the following:
1. Mark the text **Where Are We This Week?** as an `h1` heading.
2. Enclose each day’s worth of events within a separate `div` (or division) element.
3. Within each of the seven day divisions, enclose the day and date as an `h1` heading.
4. Enclose the location within a paragraph element. Insert a line break element, `<br/>`, directly before the time of the event so that each time interval is displayed on a new line within the paragraph.

# Verify Your Progress
Pause and verify that the layout and appearance of the page resemble that shown in *Figure 1–50*. Verify that each calendar event appears in its own box with the day and date rendered as a heading.
