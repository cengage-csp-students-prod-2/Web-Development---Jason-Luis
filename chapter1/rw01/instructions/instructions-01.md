# Summary

Curbside Thai has partnered with another food truck vendor Mobile Panini. Sajja asks you to create a website for the company similar to what you did for his restaurant. The site will have a home page, an online menu, a description of catering opportunities, and a calendar of upcoming events that Mobile Panini will host. A preview of the home page is shown in _Figure 1â€“50_.
