# Create the Catering Page
Go to the *mp_index.html* file in your HTML editor and copy the `header` and `footer` elements. Then, go to the *mp_catering.html* file in your HTML editor and paste the `header` and `footer` elements into the `body` element. Insert an `article` element between the `header` and `footer` and then insert an `aside` element within the `article`. 

Directly after the opening `<article>` tag, insert an `h1` element containing the text **Catering**.

Return to the *mp_pages.txt* file in your text editor and copy the text about the mobile kitchen, including the heading. Then, go to the *mp_catering.html* file in your HTML editor and paste the copied text into the `aside` element.

Within the `aside` element, do the following:
1. Mark the text **About the Mobile Kitchen** as an `h1` heading.
2. Mark the next two paragraphs as paragraphs.

Return to the **mp_pages.txt** file in your text editor and copy the text describing Mobile Paniniâ€™s catering opportunities; do not copy the Catering head. Then, go to the **mp_catering.html** file in your HTML editor and paste the copied text directly after the `aside` element.

Make the following edits to the pasted text: 
1. Mark the first two paragraphs as paragraphs.
2. Enclose the list of the six catering possibilities within an unordered list with each item marked as a list item.
3. Mark the concluding paragraph as a paragraph
