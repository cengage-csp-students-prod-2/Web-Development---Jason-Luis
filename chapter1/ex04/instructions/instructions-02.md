**Task 2**: Fix all 10 errors you discover and then resubmit the saved document to validation until it passes with no warnings or errors. Test the page in the validator at the W3C website (validator.w3.org) or with another validator of your choice. Make a note of the errors reported as a guide to debugging the page. Not every error will be initially reported.
