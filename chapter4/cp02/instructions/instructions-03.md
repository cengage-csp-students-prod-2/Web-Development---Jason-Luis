# Body Header Styles

Go to the "Body Header Styles" section and change the background color of the `body header` to **rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.5)**. 

# Aside Styles

Debra has placed useful information for the festival in `aside` elements placed within the left and right `section` elements. Go to the "Aside Styles" section and create a style rule for the `section aside` selector that adds a **10** pixel double border with color **rgba(92, 42, 8, 0.3)** and a border radius of **30** pixels.

Debra wants a curved border for every `h1` heading within an `aside` element. For the selector `section aside h1`, create a style rule that sets the border radius of the top-left and top-right corners to **30** pixels.

Define the perspective of the 3D space for the left and right sections by creating a style rule for those two sections that sets their perspective value to **450** pixels. Create a style rule that rotates the `aside` elements within the left section **25°** around the y-axis. Create another style rule that rotates the `aside` elements within the right section **–25°** around the y-axis.
