# Document Setup

Open the *cf_home.html* and *cf_effects.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *cf_home.html* file and within the document `head`, create a link to the *cf_reset.css*, *cf_layout.css*, and *cf_effects.css* style sheets. Take some time to study the content and structure of the document. Pay special note to the nested `div` elements in the center section of the page; you will use these to create a 3D cube design.

# HTML Styles 

Return to the *cf_effects.css* file in your editor and go to the "HTML Styles" section. Debra wants a background displaying a scene from last year’s festival. Add a style rule for the `html` element that displays the *cf_back1.png* as a fixed background, centered horizontally and vertically in the browser window and covering the entire window.

# Body Styles

Go to the "Body Styles" section and set the background color of the page `body` to **rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)**.
