For all `img` elements create a style rule that applies a **sepia** filter with a value of **1**. Add a **black** box shadow with horizontal and vertical offsets of **0** pixels and a blur radius of **20** pixels.

Create the following style rules for the five image elements:

1. For the `img1` image, translate the image **-150** pixels along the z-axis.
2. For the `img2` image, rotate the image **90** degrees around the x-axis and translate the image **-150** pixels along the z-axis.
3. For the `img3` image, rotate the image **-90** degrees around the y-axis and translate the image **150** pixels along the z-axis.
4. For the `img4` image, rotate the image **90** degrees around the y-axis and translate the image **150** pixels along the z-axis.
5. For the `img5` image, rotate the image **-90** degrees around the x-axis and translate the image **-150** pixels along the z-axis.
