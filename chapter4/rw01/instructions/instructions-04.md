4. Displays the image as a block with a `width` of **100%**.
5. Applies a **sepia** tone to the image with a value of **80%** (include the WebKit browser extension in your style sheet).

Create a style rule for the figure caption that:
1. Displays the text using the font stack **Palatino Linotype**, **Palatino**, **Times New Roman**, **serif**.
2. Sets the style to **italic**.
3. Sets the top/bottom padding to **10** pixels and the left/right padding to **0** pixels.
4. Centers the text.
