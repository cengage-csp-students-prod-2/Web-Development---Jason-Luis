# Document Setup

 Open the *tb_visual3.css*, *tb_visual4.css*, *tb_ferris.html* and *tb_kathleen.html* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *tb_ferris.html* file and add links to the *tb_base.css*, *tb_styles3.css*, and *tb_visual3.css* style sheets in the order listed.

Scroll down and, within the `main` element header and after the `h1` heading, insert a figure box containing:
1. The *tb_ferris.png* inline image with the alternate text **Ferris Family** using the image map named `portrait_map`.
2. A figure caption with the text **Kathleen Ferris and daughter Linda (1961)**.

Directly below the figure box, create the `portrait_map` image map containing the following hotspots:
1. A rectangular hotspot pointing to the *tb_kathleen.html* file with the left-top coordinate **(10, 50)** and the right-bottom coordinate **(192, 223)** and alternate text, **Kathleen Ferris**
2. A circular hotspot pointing to the *tb_linda.html* file with a center point at **(264, 108)** and a radius of **80** pixels and the alternate text, **Linda Ferris-White**.
