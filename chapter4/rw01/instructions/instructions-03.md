# HTML Styles

Open the *tb_visual3.css* file in order to create the graphic design styles for the page. Go to the "HTML Styles" section and create a style rule for the `html` element to use the image file *tb_back5.png* as the background.

# Page Body Styles

Go to the "Page Body Styles" section and create a style rule for the `body` element that:
1. Adds a left and right **3** pixel solid border with color value **rgb(169, 130, 88)**
2. Adds a box shadow to the right border with a horizontal offset of **25** pixels, a vertical offset of **0** pixels and a **35** pixel blur and a color value of **rgb(53, 21, 0)**, and then adds the mirror images of this shadow to the left border. 

# Main Styles

Go to the "Main Styles" section. Create a style rule for the `main` element that:
1. Applies the *tb_back7.png* file as a background image with a size of **100%** covering the entire background with no tiling and positioned with respect to the padding box
2. Adds two inset box shadows, each with a **25** pixel blur and a color value of **rgb(71, 71, 71)**, and then one with offsets of **â€“10** pixels in the horizontal and vertical direction and the other with horizontal and vertical offsets of **10** pixels.

Create a style rule for the `h1` heading within the `main` header that adds the following two text shadows:
1. A shadow with the color value **rgb(221, 221, 221)** and offsets of **1** pixels and no blurring
2. A shadow with the color value **rgba(41, 41, 41, 0.9)** and offsets of **5** pixels and a **20** pixel blur.
