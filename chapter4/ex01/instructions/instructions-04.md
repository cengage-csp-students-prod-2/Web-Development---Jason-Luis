Open the _code4-1_back.css_ file and create a style rule for the `figure` element that:

1. Sets the padding space to **20** pixels.
2. Adds a **20**-pixel border in the ridge style with the color value **rgb(52, 52, 180)**.
3. Has a background consisting of the image file _ws.png_ placed in the bottom right corner of the `figure` box and set to **45%** of the `width` of the `figure` box with no tiling. Be sure to separate the position of the image and its size with the / character. Add a second background containing the color **rgba(52, 52, 180, 0.3)**. Enter both background properties within a single style rule separated by a comma.
4. Has a black box shadow that is **5** pixels to the right, **10** pixels down with a blur size of **15** pixels.
