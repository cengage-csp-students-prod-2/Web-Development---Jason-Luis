Set the growth and shrink rate of the `div` elements of the card class to **1** and **1**. Set the flex basis of those elements to **200** pixels. Display each `div` element of the `card` class itself as a flexbox.

Next, apply the following flex layout to the items within the `card` `div` elements:

1. Lay out the items in column order with no wrapping.
2. Justify the content of the items within the `flexbox` with space between.
3. Center each of the items with respect to the cross axis.

> Complete this task in conjunction with the previous task: "Style the `section` element as a `flexbox`".
