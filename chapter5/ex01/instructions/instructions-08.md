Create a media query for devices with a minimum width of **710** pixels. Within the query do the following:

1. Set the `float` property of the `nav` element to **none**, its `width` to **100%** and its `height` to **auto**. Set the `nav` element margins to **0**.
2. Set the `display` of `ul` elements of the `mainmenu` class to flex with the flex flow in the row direction with no wrapping; justify the contents of the flexbox in the center.
3. Set the flex property of `li` elements with the `ul.mainmenu` element to have a growth factor of **0**, a shrink factor of **1**, and a basis value of **120** pixels.
