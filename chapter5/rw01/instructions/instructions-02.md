# Document Setup
Open the *tf_tips.html*, *tf_styles4.css*, and *tf_print2.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *tf_tips.html* file and add a `viewport` `meta` tag to the document `head` to set the `width` of the layout viewport equal to the `width` of the device and set the initial scale of the viewport to **1.0**.

Create links to the following style sheets:
1. The *tf_base.css* file to be used with all devices.
2. The *tf_styles4.css* file to be used with screen devices.
3. The *tf_print2.css* file to be used for printed output.

Open the *tf_styles4.css* file. Note that Marjorie has placed all of her styles in the *tf_designs.css* file and imported them into this style sheet. You will not need to edit that style sheet file, but you might want to view it to become familiar with her style rules.
