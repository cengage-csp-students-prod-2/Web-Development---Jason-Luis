# Summary
Marjorie meets with you to discuss the redesign of the blog page showing parenting tips. As with the other pages you’ve worked on, she wants this page to be compatible with mobile devices, tablet and desktop devices, and printers. Marjorie has already written the page content and has done much of the initial design work. She needs you to complete the project by writing media queries for the different display options. *Figure 5–61* shows a preview of the mobile design and the desktop design.

A list of archived dates is displayed at the bottom of the page in several columns. In the desktop version, the navigation list is displayed under the header and the archived dates are displayed on the left pane. ](../assets/VKg7EzVuSFu7HG16clcD.png)

You’ll use several flexboxes to create the layout for these two designs so that the page content automatically rescales as the screen width changes.
