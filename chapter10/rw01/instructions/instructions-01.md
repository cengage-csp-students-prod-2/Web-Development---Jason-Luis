# Summary

Lewis wants you to write another script that shows a table of events at the Lyman Hall Theater over the next two weeks from the current date. He has already created three arrays for use with the script:
* The `eventDates` array containing a list of dates and time at which theater events are scheduled
* The `eventDescriptions` array containing the description of those events
* The `eventPrices` array containing the admission prices of those events

Lewis has already written the page content and provided style sheets for use with the page. Your job will be to write a script that selects the events that occur in the two-week window from the current date and display them in the web page. A preview of the page you will create is shown in **Figure 10â€“38**.
