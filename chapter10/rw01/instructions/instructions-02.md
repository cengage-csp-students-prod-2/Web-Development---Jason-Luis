# Document Setup

Open the _lht_events.html_ and _lht_table.js_ files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the _lht_events.html_ file and directly above the closing `</head>` tag, insert `script` elements that link the page to the _lht_list.js_ and _lht_table.js_ files in that order. Defer the loading and running of both script files until after the page has loaded.

# Create the Table

Scroll down the document and, directly after the closing `</article>` tag, insert a `div` element with the ID `eventList`. It is within this element that you will write the HTML code for the table of upcoming theater events. Close the file saving your changes.

> Be sure to review this file and all the support files, noting especially the names of variables that you will be using in the code you create.
