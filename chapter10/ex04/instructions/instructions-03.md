Open the _debug10-4.js_ file and fix the syntax errors in the following locations to allow the code to run correctly (there are no logic errors in the code):

1. Fix the statement that declares the `thisDay` variable.
2. Fix the statement that declares the `monthName` variable.
3. Fix the `for` loop that calls the `writeMonthTable()` function.
4. Fix the code that writes the value of the `htmlCode` variable into the element with ID **calendar**.
5. Fix the three `if` statements found within the `writeMonthTable()` function.
