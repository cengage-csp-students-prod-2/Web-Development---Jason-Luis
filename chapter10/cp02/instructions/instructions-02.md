# Document Setup

Open the *vw_election.html* and *vw_results.js* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *vw_election.html* file and directly above the closing `</head>` tag, insert `script` elements to link the page to the *vw_congminn.js* and *vw_results.js* files in that order. Defer the loading and running of both script files until after the page has loaded.

Scroll down the file and, directly above the `footer`, insert an empty `section` element. You will write the HTML code of the election report in this element.

Open the *vw_congminn.js* file and study the contents. Note that the file contains the results of 8 congressional elections in Minnesota. The candidate information is stored in multidimensional arrays named `candidate`, `party`, and `votes`. Do not make any changes to this file.
