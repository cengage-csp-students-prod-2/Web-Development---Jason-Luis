# Table Header Styles

Kyle wants you to format the table heading cells from the table header row. Go to the "Table Header Styles" section and create a style rule to set the font color of the text within the `thead` element to **white** and the background color to a **medium green** with the value **rgb(105, 177, 60)**.

The different cells in the table header row should be formatted with different text and background colors. Using the `first-of-type` pseudo-class, create a style rule that changes the background color of the first `th` element with the `thead` element to **rgb(153, 86, 7)**.

Using the `nth-of-type` pseudo-class, create style rules that change the background color of the **7**th and **8**th `th` elements within the `thead` element to **rgb(153, 0, 153)**.

# Table Footer Styles
Kyle wants the table footer to be formatted in a different text and background color from the rest of the table. Go to the "Table Footer Styles" section. Create a style rule for the `tfoot` element that sets the font color to **white** and the background color to **black**.
