# Column Styles
Return to the *dlr_columns2.css* file. Kyle wants the introductory paragraph to appear in a three column layout for desktop devices. Within the "Column Styles" section, create a media query for screen devices with minimum widths of **641** pixels. Within the media query, create a style rule for the paragraph element that:
1. sets the column count to **3**,
2. sets the column gap to **20** pixels, and
3. adds a **1** pixel **solid black** dividing line between columns.

Open the *dlr_mornings.html* file in your browser and verify that the table layout and design resemble that shown in *Figure 6â€“52*.
