Open _code6-2_table.css_ and create the following style rules for the indicated elements:

1. For the `table` element: Add a **20** pixel margin around the table and collapse the table borders.
2. For the `th` element nested within the table row of the table header row group: Set the font color to **white**, the background color to **red**, and the font size to **1.5em**. Add a **1** pixel **solid gray** border around the element.
3. For every `td` element: Set the `width` and `height` to **50** pixels, the font size to **0.7em**, the border to a **1** pixel **solid gray**, and align the text with the top-left corner of the cell.
4. For every `td` element of the blank class: Change the background to a linear gradient going toward the bottom-right corner of the element and transitioning from **red** to **gray**.
