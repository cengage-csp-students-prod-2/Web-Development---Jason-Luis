Add the table body section and within the table body, create the layout of the crossword puzzle subject to the following conditions:

1. The table will contain **9** rows and **8** columns.
2. Within each row will be a number of table data cells. If the cell is a blank cell shown in _Figure 6–49_, assign it the class name `blank`. If a blank cell covers multiple rows and/or columns, make that cell a spanning cell and adjust the number of cells in subsequent rows and columns accordingly to preserve the table layout.
3. Several cells contain numbers that will be used as crossword puzzle clues. Number the appropriate cells from **1** up to **26** to match the layout in _Figure 6–49_.
