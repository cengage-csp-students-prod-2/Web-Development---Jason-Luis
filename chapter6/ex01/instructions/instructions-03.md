Below the `body header`, create a table using the `table` element. Add the following features to the table:

1. Insert a `caption` containing the text **February 5, 2021**.
2. Insert a column group containing a column with the id `firstCol` and a column with the id `hourCols` that spans **9** columns.
3. Insert a table head group that contains a single row with `th` elements containing the text **Conference Room** and the times **8:00am** through **4:00pm** in one-hour increments.
4. Insert a table body group that contains the four rows shown in _Figure 6â€“48_ for each of the four conference rooms. Within each row insert a `th` element containing the name of the conference room. Following that `th` cell insert the groups reserving the room in `td` elements. If a group has reserved a room for longer than an hour, have the `td` cell span the number of columns for that reservation.
