# Summary

**The Lyman Hall Theater** - Lewis Kern is an events manager at the Lyman Hall Theater in Brookhaven, Georgia. The theater is in the process of updating its website, and Lewis has asked you to work on the pages detailing events in the upcoming year. He’s asked you to create a calendar page that lists the upcoming events for September. A list of the events is stored in the lht_schedule.txt file. Lewis wants a responsive design so that the calendar is readable for both mobile and desktop users. In addition to the calendar, Lewis wants the article describing the September events displayed in column layout. He suggests that you set the width of the columns, allowing the number of columns to be determined based on the width of the display screen. *Figure 6–54* shows a preview of the page you will create for the theater viewed using mobile and desktop devices.
