# Tablet and Desktop Styles Continued...

Lewis wants the September dates to appear in a different format from the August and October dates. Create a style rule for data cells whose `data-date` attribute contains the text **Sep** that:
1. changes the background color to the semi-transparent value **rgba(232, 214, 148, 0.6)** and
2. adds a **gray** inset box shadow with horizontal and vertical offsets of **0** pixels and a blur of **20** pixels.

Create a style rule for the `table` `caption` that:
1. displays the caption at the top of the `table`,
2. centers the caption text,
3. adds **10** pixels to the bottom padding space, and
4. sets the font size to **1.2em** and the letter spacing to **3** pixels.

For heading cells within the `table` `header`, create a style rule to change the background color to **rgb(154, 64, 3)** and the text color to **white**.

# Column Styles

Lastly, open *lht_columns.css* file and within the "Column Styles" section, create a style rule for the `article` element that:
1. sets the column `width` to **260** pixels,
2. sets the column gap to **20** pixels,
3. adds a **1** pixel solid dividing line between columns with color value **rgb(154, 64, 31)**, and
4. sets the minimum size of widows and orphans to **2** lines. 

Create a style rule for the `h1` heading with the `article` element that extends the heading across all columns.

Verify that for desktop widths, the table appears as shown in right image of *Figure 6–54* and the number of columns used in the introductory article changes from 2 to 3 based on the page width. Reduce the page width to below **640** pixels and verify that the calendar information is displayed in two columns as shown in the left image in *Figure 6–54*.
