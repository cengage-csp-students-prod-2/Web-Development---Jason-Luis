# Call the `showClock()` Function

Directly after the opening comment section in the file, insert a command to call the `showClock()` function. After the command that calls the `showClock()` function, insert a command that runs the `showClock()` function every second.

Document your work in this script file with comments. Then open the *tny_july.html* file in the browser preview. Verify that the page shows the date and time of **May 19, 2021 at 9:31:27 a.m.**, and that the countdown clock shows that **Countdown to the Fireworks 46 days, 11 hours, 28 minutes, and 33 seconds**. The countdown clock will not change because the script uses a fixed date and time for the `thisDay` variable.

Return to the *tny_timer.js* file and change the statement that declares the `thisDay` variable so that it contains the current date and time rather than a specific date and time, then reload the *tny_july.html* file in the browser preview. Verify that the countdown clock changes every second as it counts down the time until the start of the fireworks at 9 p.m. on the 4th of July.
