Create the `countdown()` function and within the function add the following:

1. Declare the `secsString` variable by calling the `addLeadingZero()` function using the `secsLeft` variable as the function value. The `addLeadingZero()` function is used to add leading zeroes to numeric values from **0** to **9**.
2. Change the text content of the document element with the ID **seconds** to the value of the `secsString` variable.
3. Run the `checkCountdown()` function to determine whether the end of the countdown has been reached.
4. Use the decrement operator to reduce the value of the `secsLeft` variable by **1**.
