# Grid Styles

Next, you will create the grid styles for the March Specials page. Go to the "Grid Styles" section and create a style rule for the `body` element that displays the element as a grid with two columns in the proportion of 2:1 (using **fr** units) with a column grid gap of **20** pixels.

Create a style rule for the `header` and `footer` elements that has both elements span the grid columns from the gridline number **1** to gridline number **-1**.

Create a style rule for the `section` element with the id `sub` that displays that element as a grid consisting of three columns of equal width by repeating the column width **1fr** three times.

# Special Styles

Go to the "Specials Styles" section. In this section, you will create styles for the monthly specials advertised by the company. Create a style rule for all `div` elements of the `specials` class that sets the minimum height to **400** pixels and adds a **1** pixel dashed outline around the element with a color value of **rgb(71, 52, 29)**.
