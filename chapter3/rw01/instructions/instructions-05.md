# Award Styles

Go to the "Award Styles" section. In this section, you will create styles for the list of awards won by Pandaisia Chocolates. Information boxes for the awards are placed within an `aside` element.

Create a style rule for the `aside` element that places it using relative positioning, sets its `height` to **650** pixels, and automatically displays scrollbars for any overflow content.

Every information box in the `aside` element is stored in a `div` element. Create a style rule that places these elements with absolute positioning and sets their `width` to **30%**.

Position the individual awards within the awardList box by creating style rules for the `div` elements with id values ranging from `award1` to `award5` at the following (top, left) coordinates:

1. `award1` **(80px, 5%)**,
2. `award2` **(280px, 60%)**,
3. `award3` **(400px, 20%)**,
4. `award4` **(630px, 45%)**,
5. `award5` **(750px, 5%)**.

> In the _pc_specials.html_ file, the five awards have been placed in a `div` element belonging to the `awards` class with id values ranging from `award1` to `award5`.
