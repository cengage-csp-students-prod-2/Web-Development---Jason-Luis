# Document Setup

Open the *ss_dday.html* and *ss_layout.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *ss_dday.html* file and within the document `head`, create links to the *ss_styles.css* and *ss_layout.css* style sheet files. Study the content and structure of the document. Note that within the `aside` element is an image for the battle map with the id `mapImage`. Also note that there are six marker images enclosed within hypertext links with IDs ranging from `marker1` to `marker6`. After each marker image are `div` elements of the `mapInfo` class with IDs ranging from `info1` to `info6`. Part of your style sheet will include style rules to display these `div` elements in response to the mouse pointer hovering over each of the six marker images.

# Article Styles

 Open the *ss_layout.css* file and go to the "Article Styles" section. Within this section, youâ€™ll lay out the article describing the Normandy Invasion. Create a style rule to float the `article` element on the left margin and set its `width` to **384** pixels.
