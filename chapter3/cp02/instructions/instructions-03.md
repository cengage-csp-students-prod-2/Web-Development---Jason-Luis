# First Line and Drop Cap Styles

Jakob wants the first line from the article to be displayed in small capital letters. Go to the "First Line and Drop Cap Styles" section and create a style rule for the first paragraph of the `article` element and the first line of that paragraph, setting the font size to **1.25em** and the font variant to small-caps.

> Use the `first-of-type` pseudo-class for the paragraph and the `first-line` pseudo-element for the first line of that paragraph.

Jakob also wants the first letter of the first line in the article’s opening paragraph to be displayed as a drop cap. Create a style rule for the article’s first paragraph and first letter that applies the following styles:

1. Sets the size of the first letter to **4em** in a **serif** font and floats it on the left,
2. Sets the line height to **0.8em**, and
3. Sets the right and bottom margins to **5** pixels.

> Use the `first-letter` pseudo-element for the first letter of that paragraph.

# Aside Styles

The interactive map is placed within an `aside` element that Jakob wants displayed alongside the Normandy Invasion article. Go the "Aside Styles" section and create a style rule that sets the `width` of the `aside` element to **768** pixels and floats it on the left margin.
