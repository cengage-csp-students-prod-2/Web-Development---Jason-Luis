Create a style rule for the `body` element that:

1. Sets the `width` to **90%** of the browser window, ranging from a minimum width of **640** pixels up to a maximum width of **1024** pixels.
2. Sets the top/bottom margin to **30** pixels and the left/right margin to **auto**.
3. Displays the `body` as a CSS grid.
4. Creates six grid columns each with a `width` of **1fr**.
5. Creates five grid rows with widths of **50** pixels, **30** pixels, **1fr**, **1fr**, and **100** pixels.
6. Adds a grid gap of **15** pixels.
