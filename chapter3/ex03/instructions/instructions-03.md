Go to the _code_scroll.css_ file and create a style rule for the `section` element with the id `container` with the following styles:

1. Set the `width` of the element to **900** pixels and the `height` to **370** pixels.
2. Horizontally center the element by adding a **10** pixel top/bottom margin and set the left/right margin to **auto**.
3. Place the element with relative positioning, setting the top value to **30** pixels and the left value to **0** pixels.
4. Add a **2** pixel solid brown outline to the element.
5. Have the browser automatically display scrollbars for any overflow content.
