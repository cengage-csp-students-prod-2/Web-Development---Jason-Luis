**Task 4**: Create a style rule for every `div` element, setting the `width` to **300** pixels and the `height` to **330** pixels. Position the element with `absolute` positioning. There are nine `div` elements with ids ranging from `slide1` to `slide9`. Set the left position of the elements in **300** pixel increments starting with **0** pixels for `slide1`, **300** pixels for `slide2`, **600** pixels for `slide3`, and so forth up to **2400** pixels for `slide9`.
