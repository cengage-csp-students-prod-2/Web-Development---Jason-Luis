To create a drop cap insert a style rule for the selector `p:first-of-type::first-letter` and add the following styles:

1. Float the element on the left margin.
2. Set the font size to **4em** and the line height to **0.8em**.
3. Set the size of the right margin and padding space to **0.1em**. Set the bottom padding to **0.2em**.

Display the first line of the speech in small caps by adding a style rule for the selector `p:first-of-type::first-line` that changes the font variant to small-caps and the font size to **1.4em**.
