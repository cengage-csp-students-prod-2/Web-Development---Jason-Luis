# Create the Payment Form

Next, insert a payment form. Directly below the **Payment Form** `h1` header, insert a `form` element that employs action at `http://www.example.com/sb/payment` via the `post` method. Assign the web form the id `payment`.

Insert a field set with the id `billing` to the payment form. Add the legend **Billing Information (required)** to the field set.

Within the billing field set, add the labels and input boxes specified in *Figure 7â€“68*. Note that none of the input boxes contain placeholder text. You do not need to enclose the `label` or `input` elements within `div` elements.

Create a data list with the ID `stateList` containing the two-letter abbreviations of all the states. (You can use the list of abbreviations in the *sb_state.txt* file.) Apply the data list to the `stateBox` input text box. 

The text of the zip field should follow the `^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$` regular expression pattern. The text of the phone field should follow the `^\d{10}$|^(\(\d{3}\)\s*)?\d{3}[\s-]?\d{4}$` pattern. Note that both regular expression patterns can be found in the *sb_regex.txt* file.
