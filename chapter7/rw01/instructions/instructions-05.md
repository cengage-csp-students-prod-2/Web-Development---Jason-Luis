# Verify Form Behavior and Styles

Open the _rb_customer.html_ file in the browser preview. Verify the following:

1. The content and the layout of the form resemble the form shown in _Figure 7â€“63_.
2. If you submit the form by clicking the **Begin Building your Own** button with no customer name or phone number, the browser warns you of the missing values.
3. As you enter text into the `custName` field, the input box background changes to show that the field value is valid.
4. When you enter a phone number into the `custPhone` field, the input box provides inline validation to indicate whether a valid phone number has been entered.
5. When you click the submit button for a successfully completed form, the browser displays the alert message that the form data passes the initial validation test.
