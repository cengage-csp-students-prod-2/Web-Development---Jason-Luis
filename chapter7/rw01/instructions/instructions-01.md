# Summary

Alice wants you to start work on an online order form for customers to place orders through the Red Ball Pizza website. The form will span several pages in which customers will specify whether the order is for pickup or delivery and will indicate the toppings they want on their pizza(s). *Figure 7–63* shows a preview of the form customers will use to indicate their delivery option (including an address or pickup and at what time they want their order).

![A screenshot of a Red Ball Pizza webpage displays the Customer Information form. The webpage content contains descriptive text at the top, followed by two fields and two radio option buttons below. The text areas for delivery options and pickup options are displayed below the fields. A Begin Building you Order button is located at the left bottom of the webpage.](../assets/FQdRz2UQyCoqeMBXtuMc.png)

Alice has already written some of the HTML code for the web pages and designed many of the style sheets. Your job will be to write the code for the form elements and validation styles.
