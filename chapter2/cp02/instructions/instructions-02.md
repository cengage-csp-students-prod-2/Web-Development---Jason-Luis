# Document Setup

Open the *cw_class.html* and *cw_styles.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file.

Next, go to the *cw_class.html* file and within the document `head`, create a link to the *cw_styles.css* style sheet file. 

Using the Google Fonts website, locate the **Limelight** font. Copy the code for the `link` element to use this font and paste the copied code to the document `head` in the *cw_class .html* file.

Study the content and structure of the *cw_class.html* file and then close the file. 

Open to the *cw_styles.css* file. At the top of the file, define the character encoding as **utf-8**. On the next line, use the `@import` rule to import the contents of the *cw_layout.css* file into the style sheet.
