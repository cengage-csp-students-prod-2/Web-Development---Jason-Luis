# Navigation Styles

Go the "Navigation Styles" section. In this section, you format the navigation list that has the ID `mainLinks`. For hypertext links within this navigation list, set the top and bottom padding space to **5** pixels.

For previously visited and unvisited links within the `mainLinks` navigation list, create a style rule that displays the hypertext links in a **white** font.

For hovered or active links within the `mainLinks` navigation list, create a style rule that displays the hypertext links in **white** with an opacity of **0.8** and set the background color to the value **rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.5)**.

# Outline Styles

Go to the "Outline Styles" section. In this section, you’ll format the course outline that appears on the page’s left column. The navigation list in this outline has the ID `outline`. Create a style rule for this navigation list that sets the text color to **rgb(51, 51, 51)** and the font size to **0.8em**.

Horizontally center the `h1` headings within the outline navigation list. For the first level `ol` elements that are a direct child of the `outline` navigation list, create a style rule that sets the line height to **2em**, the top/bottom margin to **0** pixels and the left/right margin to **5** pixels. Display the list marker as an upper-case Roman numeral.

Display the second level of `ol` elements nested within the outline navigation list with an uppercase letter as the list marker.

Display all previously visited and unvisited links in the outline navigation list using the color value **rgb(101, 101, 101)**.

Display hovered and active links in the outline navigation list using the color value **rgb(97, 97, 211)** with the text underlined.
