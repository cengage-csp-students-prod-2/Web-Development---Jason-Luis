# Document Setup
Open the *tss_coach.html* and *coach_styles.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file.

Next, go to the *tss_coach.html* file and within the document `head`, create links to the *coach_layout.css* and *coach_styles.css* style sheets. 

Close the *tss_coach.html* file and open the *coach_styles.css* file and at the top of the file and before the comment section do the following:
1. Insert an `@charset` rule to set the character encoding for the file to `utf-8`.
2. Use the `@font-face` rule to define a web font named **Nobile**, which is based on the *nobile-webfont.woff* file and, if that format is not supported, on the *nobile-webfont.ttf* file.
