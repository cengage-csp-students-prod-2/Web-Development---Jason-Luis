# Blockquote Styles

Alison has inserted a comment from an athlete about the coaches. Format this comment by going to the "Blockquote Style" section and creating a style rule for the `aside blockquote` selector to do the following:
1. Set the font size to **0.95em** using the font stack: **‘Comic Sans MS’**, **cursive**.
2. Set the font color to **rgb(222, 128, 60)** and use a semi-transparent background color with the value **rgba(255, 2555, 255, 0.75)**.
3. Set the padding space to **10** pixels.
Define opening and closing quotes for the element using the Unicode character `201C` and `201D` respectively. 

Format the appearance of the opening quotes by creating a style rule for the `aside blockquote::before` selector to write a boldfaced open quote before the block quote with the font size set to **1.6em** from the font stack: **‘Times New Roman’**, **Times**, **serif**. 

Format the appearance of the closing quotes by creating a style rule for the `aside blockquote::after` selector to write a boldfaced close quote after the block quote with the font size once again set to **1.6em** from the font stack: **‘Times New Roman’**, **Times**, **serif**. 

# Navigation Styles

Next, you’ll format the appearance of the navigation list by going to the "Navigation Styles" section and creating a style rule for `body > nav` selector that sets the text of the navigation list in a **0.8em** font size with a line height of **2em**.

Create a style rule for the `nav > ul` selector that removes the list marker and sets the left padding to **5** pixels.

Alison wants to break up the long list of links in the navigation list. Create style rules for the 6th and 16th `li` elements within the `nav > ul` selector that sets the size of the top margin of those items to **20** pixels.

For every previously visited or unvisited hypertext link within the `nav > ul > li` selector, set the text to the RGB color value **rgb(151, 151, 151)** and remove the underlining from the text link.

For every hovered or active hypertext link within the `nav > ul > li` selector, set the text color to RGB value **rgb(222, 128, 60)** and underline the hypertext link.
