# Main Structural Styles

Go to the "Main Structural Styles" section in the *coach_styles.css* file and do the following:
1. Change the background color of the browser window by creating a style rule for the `html` element that sets the background color to the value **hsl(27, 72%, 72%)**.
2. For the `body` element, create a style rule to set the text color to the value **rgb(91, 91, 91)**, the background color to **ivory**, and body text to the font stack: **Verdana**, **Geneva**, **sans-serif**.

Create a style rule for the `body > footer address` selector containing the following styles:
1. The background color set to the value **rgb(222, 128, 60)**.
2. The font color to **white** and then to the semi-transparent value **rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)**.
3. The font style to **normal** displayed in bold small capital letters with a font size of **0.9em** and a line height of **3em** using the font stack: **Nobile**, **Verdana**, **Geneva**, **sans-serif**.
4. The text horizontally centered on the page. 

# Heading Styles
 Go to the "Heading Styles" section and create a style rule for every `h1` heading that displays the text with a **normal** font weight from the font stack: **Nobile**, **Verdana**, **Geneva**, **sans-serif**. Set the letter spacing to **0.2em** and the margins to **0** pixels. 

Alison wants you to format the main `h1` heading at the top of the page. Create a style rule for the `section#tss_coaches h1` selector that sets the font size to **2.5em** with a color value of **hsl(27, 82%, 85%)** and background color of **hsl(27, 6%, 21%)**. Set the left padding space to **10** pixels. 

Alison also wants you to format the `h2` headings for each coach. Create a style rule for the `article.coach_bio h2` selector that sets the font size to **1.6em** with **normal** weight and the font color to **rgb(240, 125, 0)**.
