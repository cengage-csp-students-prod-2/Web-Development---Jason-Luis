Create a style rule for `img` elements within hovered figure elements that:

1. Sets the `width` to **100%**
2. Applies the `drop-shadow(offset-x offset-y blur-radius color)` and `grayscale(0)` filter functions,
3. Sets the drop shadow offset to **10** pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions and the blur radius to **20** pixels,
4. Sets the color value to **black**, and
5. Applies a transition to the change in the filter property over a **2**-second interval.
