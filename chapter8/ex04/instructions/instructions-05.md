When the **Credit Card Number** box and the **CSC** box receive the focus, a transition effect should appear that slowly adds a glowing brown shadow around the boxes. The glowing brown shadow appears but without a transition effect. Return to the _code8-4_debug.css_ file and study the code that applies a transition effect to both the `input#cardBox` and `input#CSC` objects, and the `input#csc:invalid` style. Correct any mistakes you find in the code. Verify that when the **Credit Card Number** and **CSC** boxes receive the focus a transition effect appears that adds the glowing brown shadow to the boxes.
