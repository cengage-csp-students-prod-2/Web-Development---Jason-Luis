A **3**-digit number should be entered in the **CSC** box. If something other than a **3** digit number is entered, the box should wiggle back and forth to indicate invalid data. That is not currently happening. Open the _code8-4_debug.css_ file. Study the code that applies the transition effect to the `input#csc` object when invalid data is entered. Correct any mistakes in the code that you find. Verify that when you enter invalid data in the **CSC** box, the box wiggles back and forth to indicate that the data is not valid.
