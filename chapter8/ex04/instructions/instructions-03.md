Open the _code8-4.html_ file. When the page opens, the `h1` heading should slide into the page from the left and the form should drop in from the top. Neither is happening. Open the _code8-4_debug.css_ file and study the code that applies the animation effect to the `form#payment` object and the `h1` element. Fix any mistakes in the code that you find and verify that the opening of the page runs the drop-in and slight-right animations.
