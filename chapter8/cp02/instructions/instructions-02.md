# Document Setup

Open the *paa_game.html* and *paa_animate.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *paa_game.html* file and add a `link` to the *paa_animate.css* style sheet file to the document `head`. 

Scroll down to the `gameBox` `div` element. Within this element, insert three `div` elements with the ids `butterfly`, `bat`, and `fox` and belonging to the `sprite` class. These `div` elements will contain animated backgrounds showing three characters from the game.

# Transition Effects

Open the *paa_animate.css* file and within the "Transition Effects" section, insert a style rule for the `nav#gameLinks a` selector that:
1. places the links using relative positioning,
2. sets the font color to **white**, and
3. transitions the font color over a **0.5** second interval.

Insert a style rule for the `nav#gameLinks a:hover` selector that sets the font color to **rgb(255, 194, 99)**.
