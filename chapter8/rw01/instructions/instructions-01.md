# Summary

Maxine has been working on new pages at the Cinema Penguin website. She has returned for help on a page featuring a profile of Fred Astaire. Maxine created a sound clip from one of Astaire’s songs in the Royal Wedding and a video clip of a dance in that movie featuring Astaire’s duet with a hat rack. She wants both clips embedded on the page. In addition, Maxine wants you to try a new hover  transition for the links at the top of the page. Finally, she wants you to create an animation that displays a scrolling marquee of the Fred Astaire filmography. **Figure 8–63** shows a preview of the final page.
