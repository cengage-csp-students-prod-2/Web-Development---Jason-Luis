# Document Setup

Open the _cp_astaire.html_, _cp_media2.css_, and _cp_animate2.css_ files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Go to the _cp_astaire.html_ file and insert links to the _cp_media2.css_ and _cp_animate2.css_ files. Take some time to study the contents and structure of the document.

# Insert the Audio Clip

Scroll down to the `aside` element titled “Listen up”. Directly after the introductory paragraph, insert an audio clip with the audio controls displayed in the browser. Add two possible source files to the audio clip: _cp_song.mp3_ and _cp_song.ogg_. Identify the **mime-type** of each audio source. In case a browser does not support HTML5 audio, display a paragraph with the message **Upgrade your browser to HTML5**.

> The audio will not be audible using the browser preview in the lab environment.

# Insert the Video Clip

Scroll down to the `aside` element titled “In Focus” and after the introductory paragraph insert a video clip with the video controls enabled and display the poster image _cp_poster.png_. Add two possible sources to the video clip: _cp_hatrack.mp4_ and _cp_hatrack.webm_. Include the **mime-type** for each video source. If the user’s browser does not support HTML5 video, display a paragraph with the message **Upgrade your browser to HTML5**.

Directly after the two video sources in the `video` element you created in the last step, insert a caption track using the captions you will specify in the _cp_captions2.vtt_ file in later steps. Set the value of the `kind` attribute to **captions** and give the caption track the `label` **Movie Captions** and set it as the default track for the video clip.
