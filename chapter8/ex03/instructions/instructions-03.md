Open the _code8-3_anim.css_ file. Several keyframe animations have already been created for you. Add a keyframe animation named `spinCube` that contains the following frames:

1.  At **0%** apply the transform property with the `rotateX()` function set to **24deg** and the `rotateY()` function set to **40deg**.
2.  At **50%** change the value of the `rotateX()` function to **204deg** and the `rotateY()` function to **220deg**
3.  At **100%**, change the value of the `rotateX()` function to **384** and the `rotateY()` function to **400deg**.
